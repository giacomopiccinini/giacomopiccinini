## Hi!

I am Giacomo, a Machine Learning engineer specialising in Computer Vision. I am currently (remotely) working at Gemmo AI, a Dublin-based start-up providing bespoke Deep Learning solutions. 

In my previous life I was a String Theorist at Swansea University (Wales), where I learnt how to survive daily rains and to efficiently drink beers. 

In my spare time, I am trying to develop tools for leveraging Deep Learning to tackle what I believe are interesting problems in the artistic aspects of Vision and Audio. 

If you are interested, get in touch with me on Twitter [@G_Piccinini_](https://twitter.com/G_Piccinini_)!

## Projects

Here is a list of the projects I am currently working on in my spare time. I have ranked them based on difficulty/size, and you can find the corresponding repos here on GitHub. If you like, do feel free to contribute!

### Milli-Projects

**DrumsGPT**: Inspire by Andrej Karpathy's NanoGPT lecture, a GPT-like model for writing (read: completing) drum tracks in MIDI format. Currently private repo, as still in the making. 

### Micro-Projects

**Annotate**: despite the questionable name, the aim is to build a set of simple yet effective tools to easily annotate immages locally, without resorting to online services which require your data to be made public (or pay yet another subscription). At the moment only supports YOLO-like bounding box annotations. Docs are in the making. 

### Nano-Projects

**chronopy**: pip-installable package to keep track of execution time in Python scripts. Currently downloadable, `pip install chronopy`. See also [this Medium post](https://medium.com/@giacomo.piccinini/chronopy-or-how-to-measure-elapsed-time-in-python-with-ease-84e1ec8a0120) about it. 

**Spotilist**: Streamlit application accessible [here](https://spotilist.streamlit.app/). Use it to find curators of Spotify playlists that include emerging artists. Try and get in touch with them to see your band featured!
