### Hi!

I am Giacomo, a Machine Learning engineer specialising in Computer Vision. I am currently (remotely) working at Gemmo AI, a Dublin-based start-up providing bespoke Deep Learning solutions. 

In my previous life I was a String Theorist at Swansea University (Wales), where I learnt how to survive daily rains and to efficiently drink beers. 

In my spare time, I am trying to develop tools for leveraging Deep Learning to tackle what I believe are interesting problems in the artistic aspects of Vision and Audio. 

If you are interested, get in touch with me on Twitter @G_Piccinini_!
