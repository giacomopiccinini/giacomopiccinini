## Hi!

I am Giacomo, a Machine Learning engineer specialising in Vision and Audio. Currently, I am the CTO at [Gemmo AI](https://gemmo.ai/), a Dublin-based start-up that provides bespoke Deep Learning solutions. 

In my previous life I was a String Theorist at Swansea University (Wales), where I learned how to survive daily rains and to efficiently drink beers. 

In my spare time, I am trying to develop tools for leveraging Deep Learning to tackle what I believe are interesting problems in the artistic aspects of Vision and Audio.

## Projects

Here is a list of the projects I am currently working on in my spare time. I have ranked them based on difficulty/size, and you can find the corresponding repos here on GitHub. If you like, do feel free to contribute!

### Actual Projects

**rush**: A Swiss-army knife for data inspection and manipulation, written in Rust.

### Milli-Projects

**DrumsGPT**: Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's NanoGPT lecture, a GPT-like model for writing (read: completing) drum tracks in MIDI format. Currently private repo, as still in the making. 

### Micro-Projects

**metrify**: pip-installable package to add some metrics )informedness, markedness, $\phi$, etc.) to the standard scikit-learn library. 

**chronopy**: pip-installable package to keep track of execution time in Python scripts. Currently downloadable, `pip install chronopy`. See also [this Medium post](https://medium.com/@giacomo.piccinini/chronopy-or-how-to-measure-elapsed-time-in-python-with-ease-84e1ec8a0120) about it. 

### Nano-Projects

**giacomo-website**: My first (and only) attempt at creating a personal website. Take a look at it [here](https://www.giacomopiccinini.xyz/) and feel free to scrape the code! Built with NextJS 14 and deployed on Vercel.

**audio-graph**: API deployed on Modal to create and compare the frequency spectra of two audio files. Ideally useful for ensuring that, when mixing a song, your track is on par with industry standard. 

**snippet-api**: API deployed on Modal to create images of code snippets automatically. Similar (but not as fancy as) Carbon.  

**Spotilist**: Streamlit application accessible [here](https://spotilist.streamlit.app/). Use it to find curators of Spotify playlists that include emerging artists. Try and get in touch with them to see your band featured!
