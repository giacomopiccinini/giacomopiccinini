## Hi!

I am Giacomo, a Machine Learning engineer specialising in Vision and Audio. Currently, I am the CTO at [Gemmo AI](https://gemmo.ai/), a Dublin-based start-up that provides bespoke Deep Learning solutions. 

In my previous life I was a String Theorist at Swansea University (Wales), where I learned how to survive daily rains and to efficiently drink beers. 

In my spare time, I am trying to develop tools for leveraging Deep Learning to tackle what I believe are interesting problems in the artistic aspects of Vision and Audio.

## Projects

Here is a list of the projects I am currently working on in my spare time. I have ranked them based on difficulty/size, and you can find the corresponding repos here on GitHub. If you like, do feel free to contribute!

### Actual Projects

**rush**: A Swiss-army knife for data inspection and manipulation, written in Rust.

### Milli-Projects

**DrumsGPT**: Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's NanoGPT lecture, a GPT-like model for writing (read: completing) drum tracks in MIDI format. Currently private repo, as still in the making. 

### Micro-Projects

**giacomo-website**: My first (and only) attempt at creating a personal website. Take a look at it [here](https://www.giacomopiccinini.xyz/) and feel free to scrape the code! Built with NextJS 14 and deployed on Vercel.

**Annotate**: despite the questionable name, the aim is to build a set of simple yet effective tools to easily annotate immages locally, without resorting to online services which require your data to be made public (or pay yet another subscription). At the moment only supports YOLO-like bounding box annotations. Docs are in the making. 

### Nano-Projects

**audio-graph**: API deployed on Modal to create and compare the frequency spectra of two audio files. Ideally useful for ensuring that, when mixing a song, your track is on par with industry standard. 

**snippet-api**: API deployed on Modal to create images of code snippets automatically. Similar (but not as fancy as) Carbon. 

**imagesum/audiosum/videosum**: Rust scripts for analysing metadata of images/audios/videos and provide a summary. Useful when dealing with large datasets. My first attempt at playing around with Rust.  

**chronopy**: pip-installable package to keep track of execution time in Python scripts. Currently downloadable, `pip install chronopy`. See also [this Medium post](https://medium.com/@giacomo.piccinini/chronopy-or-how-to-measure-elapsed-time-in-python-with-ease-84e1ec8a0120) about it. 

**Spotilist**: Streamlit application accessible [here](https://spotilist.streamlit.app/). Use it to find curators of Spotify playlists that include emerging artists. Try and get in touch with them to see your band featured!
